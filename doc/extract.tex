\chapter{Visualization Program PHASEXTRACT}   
The Phaseextract program is used to show induvidual optical abberation
combinations of abberations, energy resolution or something else. The same
input file as in the optimization package is used. 

The calculation procedure is very similar to the optimization one. The cost
function must be adapted and the the program must be recompiled.
