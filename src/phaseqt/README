PREREQUISITE 
============
(1) Fortran compiler with VAX extensions for instrance the INTEL fortran 
compiler which can be downloaded from

http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-compilers/

now (2019) we recommend the free gfortran compiler

(2) QT and QWT development kit
=======================================
if QT and QWT is not available or there are related errors during built we 
recommend to install an actual QT and QWT. With root access you can do this 
under /usr/local or anywhere else. Without root access you install it on 
your account.

BUILD phaseqt
=============
tar -xzvf phase-1.20.tar.gz
cd phase-1.20
./configure --help
./configure --enable-debug --without-cernlib --with-qt=your_qt_prefix --with-qtw=your_qtw_prefix --enable-SEVEN

cd phaseqt
make
#make install         # perhaps

RUN phaseqt
===========
./phaseqt

if shared libraries are not found you have to update the search path of the dynamic linker- either as root put an entry in /etc/ld.so.conf.d/ and run ldconfig or as normal user define the environment variable $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
