PREREQUISITE 
============
(1) Fortran compiler with VAX extensions for instrance the INTEL fortran 
compiler which can be downloaded from

http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-compilers/

(2) QT and QWT development kit
=======================================
if QT and QWT is not available or there are related errors during built we 
recommend to install an actual QT and QWT. With root access you can do this 
under /usr/local or anywhere else. Without root access you install it on 
your account.

a) download the "Qt libraries 4.7.3 for Linux/X11 (202 MB)"  from 
http://qt.nokia.com/downloads
Save the file on your account, unpack it with

tar -xzvf qt-everywhere-opensource-src-4.7.3.tar.gz
cd qt-everywhere-opensource-src-4.7.3
./configure --prefix=/usr/local

you will be asked to accept the licence, choose open-source, you may 
set another prefix according to your preference like --prefix=${HOME}/tmp/qt
the configure takes a while, then run:

make
make install

(it takes a while)

b) QWT
------
download the code from qwt.sourceforge.net

svn co https://qwt.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/qwt/branches/qwt-6.0

first you may want to edit qwtconfig.pri to define the QWT_INSTALL_PREFIX, 
    default is /usr/local/qwt-$$QWT_VERSION-svn

then call the qmake from your previously intalled qt version- use the absolute path

example: 

$HOME/tmp/bin/qmake
make
make install

BUILD phaseqt
=============
tar -xzvf phase-1.20.tar.gz
cd phase-1.20
./configure --help
./configure --enable-debug --without-cernlib --with-qt=your_qt_prefix --with-qtw=your_qtw_prefix --enable-SEVEN

cd phaseqt
make
#make install         # perhaps

RUN phaseqt
===========
./phaseqt

if shared libraries are not found you have to update the search path of the dynamic linker- either as root put an entry in /etc/ld.so.conf.d/ and run ldconfig or as normal user define the environment variable $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
